### Two Opposing Mindsets in the Workplace

This post might be for you if you ever wonder why that colleague of yours never marks that ticket as resolved, or changes the tag on a merge request from draft to ready for review. That same colleague may seem like they never finish anything or are not being productive with their time. You may even find them really frustrating to work with.

Now, you may also find yourself marking tasks as completed before getting sign-off or tackling "two birds with one stone" when tackling a task. Oh, and days you do not get to mark anything off on your list feel so unsatisifying. It's as if you have not accomplished anything that day, even after all that time spent in meetings, planning, documenting and coding.

Regardless of whether you relate to the colleague in this example or the person I propose you to be, there are clearly distinctions to how these two people work. In this post, I am going to disect these two archetypes, share my thoughts on pros and cons of each mindset, and then, propose why their co-exististence is a necessary evil.

#### Mindset 1: Plan-Review-Polish (Your Colleague)

**Pros**
- 

**Cons**
- 

#### Mindset 2: Attack-Tackle-Alter (You)

**Pros**
- 

**Cons**
-
